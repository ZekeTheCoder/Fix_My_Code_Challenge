# Fix_My_Code_Challenge

`Fix my code` is a new type of project, where we’ll jump into an existing code base and fix it! Sometimes you will know the language, sometimes not. Please download the repository 0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge and use it as initial files for all solutions. You should not recode everything, just fix it!
